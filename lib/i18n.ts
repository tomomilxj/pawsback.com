      q2: "시작하려면 무엇이 필요합니까?",
      a2: "반려동물의 사진과 비디오, 이름과 성격 특성을 업로드하기만 하면 됩니다. 우리의 AI는 독특한 캐릭터와 외모를 포착한 개인화된 가상 동반자를 생성합니다.",

      a3: "물론입니다! 가상 반려동물은 24시간 연중무휴로 쓰다듬고, 먹이를 주고, 대화하고, 놀 수 있습니다. 상호작용이 많을수록 경험은 더욱 개인화됩니다.",
      q4: "음성 기능은 어떻게 작동합니까?",
      a4: "프리미엄 회원의 경우 업로드된 비디오에서 반려동물의 고유한 발성을 추출하고 AI를 사용하여 다양한 감정적 반응을 위해 목소리를 재현하여 상호작용을 더욱 진정성 있게 만듭니다.",
      q5: "내 데이터와 추억은 안전합니까?",
      a5: "예, 모든 사진, 비디오 및 상호작용 데이터는 암호화되어 안전하게 저장됩니다. 반려동물의 프로필과 추억에 액세스할 수 있는 것은 당신뿐입니다.",
      q6: "여러 반려동물을 만들 수 있습니까?",
